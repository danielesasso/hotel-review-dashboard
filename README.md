⚠️ **Important note on the dataset**  
This project is based on a **mock / synthetic dataset** created for experimentation and learning purposes.  
In particular, **user IDs are not consistent across tables** (intentionally falsified), therefore user-level joins are not reliable.  
The focus of this project is **data visualization, dashboard design, and analytical storytelling**, not data engineering accuracy.

## 📊 Project Overview
This project explores hotel review data through an interactive Tableau dashboard, focusing on:

- Geographic distribution of hotels (heatmap)
- Customer satisfaction across multiple dimensions (radar chart)
- Satisfaction trends over time (line chart)
- Traveler demographic distributions (pie charts)

The dashboard allows users to filter by hotel and review dimensions to compare patterns and trends visually.

## 🧠 Analytical Focus
The main goals of this project were:

- Designing a **clean, interactive dashboard layout**
- Handling **multi-table datasets with imperfect relationships**
- Applying **best practices in Tableau filtering and context**

Because the dataset is synthetic, the analysis emphasizes **relative comparisons and visual insights** rather than absolute real-world conclusions.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Tableau Desktop**
- **GitHub Pages** (for embedding the dashboard)
- CSV datasets from Kaggle (mock data) (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alperenmyung/international-hotel-booking-analytics?resource=download&select=hotels.csv)
